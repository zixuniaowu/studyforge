      "id": "q1",
      "domain": 1,
      "question": "A company needs to implement a governance solution that automatically remediates non-compliant resources. When a storage account is created without HTTPS-only traffic enabled, the policy should automatically enable it. Which Azure Policy effect should be used?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Deny",
        "B": "Audit",
        "C": "DeployIfNotExists",
        "D": "Disabled"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "answerType": "single",
      "explanation": "The DeployIfNotExists effect allows Azure Policy to automatically deploy a remediation task when a non-compliant resource is detected. This can automatically enable HTTPS-only traffic on storage accounts that don't have it enabled. The Deny effect would block creation, while Audit only reports non-compliance without remediation.\n---",
